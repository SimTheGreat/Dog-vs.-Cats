# Dog-vs.-Cats
ml project classifying dogs and cats

get data from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data

the algo is not very accurate since it sometimes classifies dogs as cats, but it works most of the times

followed this tutorial:https://data-flair.training/blogs/cats-dogs-classification-deep-learning-project-beginners/
 alldough the test dataset part did not work(since the amount of predictions and amount of images were not the same)
 
in the end got about 82% accuracy
